Today, I studied vim editor. It's still a little awkward to use, but I'm learning how to use it.
The reason why I'm learning this is because
- To use the terminal easier (in MacOS)
- To learn Linux

If there's any inconvenience,
- Korean typing is difficult. (in VScode)
  - Need to check again if this is a setup issue!
